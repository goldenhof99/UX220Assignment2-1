Another experience was getting my G2 drivers license. This occurred in February, 2022. What was good about this experience was I was finally able to drive on my own. My favourite memory was when the instructor said I passed. Honestly, there was nothing bad about this experience other than being nervous for the test. Overall I would give this experience an A.
