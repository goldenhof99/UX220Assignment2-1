Another experience was graduating highschool. This occurred in June 2023. The good things about it were after four years of highschool I was finally ready to move on. Finally being an adult, it no longer made sense to be highschool and what was good was I was ready to move on. What was bad about it was I was going miss a lot of people I had created great relationships with. My favorite memory was throwing our grad caps in the air to celebrate.It is not like I will never see them again, but it is much more difficult. Overall I would give this experience a B because it is a very bitter sweet moment.
